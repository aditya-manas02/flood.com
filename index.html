                  So what are flash floods? Flash floods<strong> are quick and lethal.</strong>  Flash floods are the rapid 
				  flooding of an
				  area depending on the intensity of rainfall and it’s duration. Flash floods 
				  can occur within minutes or hours of rainfall and strike quickly. 
				  These floods can flow for miles and at extremely fast speeds.
              </p>
                <p class="mb-5 tm-intro-text">
				It is vital to your safety that you take key steps in regards to the 
				possibility of flash flooding. You must pay attention 
				to the warning signs and be prepared.

            <p>
              Flash floods prove to be a danger for their force and speed. 
			  It only takes 18 inches of water to float a car off the ground 
			  and 2 feet to force it down stream. With this power in mind, 
			  flash floods can roll boulders, rip trees from the ground, 
			  and destroy buildings, roads, or bridges.The speed of flash 
			  floods is also an extreme danger. The floods can develop in 
			  minutes and take motorists and hikers by complete surprise. 
			  With only 6 inches of water being needed to sweep you off your 
			  feet, having a flash flood show up at your feet unprepared is cause for concern.

          <h4 class="text-center tm-text-primary mb-4">The History</h4>
          <p>
            Flash floods have caused notable destruction and death in 
			the past. Even recent history has suffered from flooding. 
			In 1993 the Great Mississippi and Missouri Rivers Flood 
			caused 15 billion dollars in damage. 20 million acres 
			across nine states flooded. 54,000 people had to 
			evacuate with 50,000 homes being damaged or destroyed. 
			Some towns were never rebuilt after complete annihilation. 
			In March of 2019, record rain and snowfall flooded several
			midwest states: 3 people died, thousands evacuated, 
			and 10.9 billion dollars of damage was done.

          <h4 class="text-center tm-text-primary mb-4">The Facts</h4>
          <p>
            Floods hold some facts you should know. Most deaths occur 
			in cars. Around 150 people a year are killed in flooding, 
			more than any other weather hazard. In 2018 alone, 80 people 
			were killed by flash floods. Just one inch of water can 
			cause $25,000 worth of damage to your home.

						There are statewide warnings in the instance where a flash flood has the potential to form and 
						wreak havoc. Two types of warnings could be sent out to your cellular device if a flash flood is 
						predicted to occur. These two types are the flood watch and flood warning. It is important to 
						understand the differences in order for you and your family to take the proper precautions. A 
						flood watch will be sent out when there is the potential for flooding to occur due to heavy rains 
						forecasted. In contrast, a flood warning is when flooding is predicted to occur or has already 
						begun to occur. Families must

				</div>
				<div class="col-lg-12 mb-2">
					<div>
						<p>
						pay attention to these alerts and take them very seriously, especially 
						if they are in an area that is prone to flash floods. If there is a flood warning with a predicted 
						flash flood, families should immediately begin to move to higher ground to avoid being caught in 
						the worst of the flood since water always flows down to the lowest elevation. To protect their 
						vehicles from being washed away in a flash flood; it may be a good idea to move your vehicle away 
						from streams or other bodies of water if they are parked in close vicinity.

						<p>
						When caught in a flash flood it is important to try and remain calm so that you are able to 
						think clearly and make smart decisions. If you are in your vehicle during a fast flood and the 
						water is moving quickly do not exit the vehicle for risk of being swept away by the fast-moving water. 
						Avoid driving through the fast-moving water because it is hard to gauge the true depth and just two 
						feet of water can sweep your vehicle away. In the unfortunate event that you find yourself swept 
						away in a flash flood, lay on your back with your head facing in the same direction as the water is 
						flowing so you

				</div>

						<p>
						can see what objects are coming at you from behind. While being swept away, look for 
						anything stationary that you could safely hold onto until the flash flood is over or help arrives. 
						If you have not been swept away by the water but are near it: you must avoid going near or trying 
						to cross the water; it only takes six inches of fast-moving water to knock you off your feet. Always 
						be aware of downed power lines as well since they can electrify the water surrounding them.

              <p>
                Flash flooding beings with atmospheric conditions that bring on heavy rain or a large snowfall melt 
				after a long period. The main causes of flooding are heavy and rapid rainfall, long periods of rain 
				or snowmelt. Geographical factors that heavily contribute to flash floods are steep slopes, 
				impermeable rock, saturated and compacted soils, or dry soil. Flash floods will typically begin 
				suddenly but they develop overtime. If you live in areas with the aforementioned geographical traits 
				or weather conditions, you are most likely to experience flash flooding. 
				</br>
				The data from research around 1990 and 2006 shows that the highest number of flood cases is in November 
				with a close second in September. With what was discussed earlier, it should not be a surprise that 
				areas most susceptible to flash flooding have the heaviest rain in November and September.
